### Hi there! 👋

My name is Mike Davis, and I am a Full-Stack Web Developer, with ample experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails! Having graduated from Flatiron School's Software Engineering program in February of 2023, I've continued to sharpen my skills through freelance work & independent learning, exploring new technologies with each project. For a curated list of my work, please visit <a href="https://mikedavissoftware.com/" target="_blank">my portfolio website</a>.

Lately I have been focusing heavily on learning Data Structures & Algorithms, practicing what I've learned through Leetcode problems.
