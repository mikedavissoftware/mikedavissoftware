### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is Mike Davis, and I am a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer, with ample experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. I recently graduated from Flatiron School's Software Engineering program, and I've been keeping myself occupied by acquiring freelance projects and exploring new technologies with each project!
